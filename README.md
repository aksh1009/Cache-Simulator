## **Overview**

**Cache Simulator** is a Python program that provides a visual representation of cache memory behavior. The simulator allows users to configure cache parameters, run simulations of memory accesses, and view detailed statistics.

## **Features**

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for easy interaction.
- Configurable cache parameters: cache size, block size, and associativity.
- Simulation of memory accesses with hit/miss tracking.
- Display of simulation statistics, including hit rate.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following main files:

1. **`cache_simulator.py`**: Contains the `CacheSimulator` class, which represents the cache memory system and its operations.
2. **`gui.py`**: Contains the `CacheSimulatorGUI` class, responsible for creating the graphical user interface using Tkinter.
3. **`main.py`**: The main script that initializes the Tkinter application and runs the GUI.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-simulator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cache-simulator
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.*

## **Usage**

### 1. Launch the Application

- Follow the installation instructions.
- Execute the main script to launch the GUI.

### 2. Configure Cache Parameters

- Enter the desired cache parameters (cache size, block size, associativity) in the GUI.

### 3. Run Simulation

- Click the "Run Simulation" button to simulate memory accesses and view the results.

### 4. Update Statistics

- Click the "Update Statistics" button to display simulation statistics.

## **Screenshots**

*Include screenshots of your application in this section. You may consider adding images of the GUI, sample simulations, and statistics.*
