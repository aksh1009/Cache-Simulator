# cache-simulator
Abstract:
The Cache Simulator project aims to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) application and to simulate
memory accesses and analyze the performance of a cache system. The simulator allows users to input
cache parameters, such as size, block size, and associativity, and then runs a simulation using a
predefined set of memory accesses. The project is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python.


Problem Statement:
Understanding the behavior and performance of cache memory is crucial for optimizing computer
systems. This project addresses the need for a tool that provides a visual representation of cache
interactions, making it easier to comprehend and analyze cache hits and misses. The simulator assists in
exploring different cache configurations and their impact on overall system performance.


Implementation and Methodology:
The CacheSimulator class is the core of the cache simulation implementation. It initializes a cache with
user-specified parameters such as size, block size, and associativity. The private method _log2 is used
for calculating the base-2 logarithm, assisting in determining the number of bits required for
representation. The _lru_update method handles cache updates based on the Least Recently Used
(LRU) policy, moving accessed blocks to the most recently used position. The display_cache method
provides a visual representation of the current cache state using a Tkinter text widget.
The access_memory method simulates memory access, calculating the index, tag, and offset based on
the provided memory address, updating the cache accordingly, and logging the access details. The
simulate_memory_accesses method orchestrates a series of memory accesses, updating the cache and
displaying the results in the Tkinter text widget. This class encapsulates the essential functionality of a
cache simulator, facilitating analysis and visualization of cache behavior.
The if __name__ == "__main__": block initializes a Tkinter root window and creates an instance of the
CacheSimulatorGUI class, starting the GUI application with the mainloop() method.
This overall structure enables users to interactively explore and visualize the behavior of a cache system
through the graphical user interface, providing insights into cache hits, misses, and the impact of different
cache configurations.
