# Cache Simulator

The Cache Simulator project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) application for simulating memory accesses and analyzing cache system performance. The simulator allows users to configure cache parameters and visualize the behavior of different cache configurations.

## Features

- Simulate memory accesses and analyze cache hits and misses.
- User-friendly GUI for configuring cache parameters.
- Visual representation of cache interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version x.x)
- Tkinter library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cache-simulator.git
   cd cache-simulator
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Input cache parameters through the GUI.
3. Observe the simulation results, including cache hits, misses, and overall performance.

## Implementation Details

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `CacheSimulator` class, providing methods for cache initialization, LRU-based updates, and visual representation. The `CacheSimulatorGUI` class utilizes Tkinter for the GUI implementation.

```python
# Example code snippet:
from cache_simulator import CacheSimulator, CacheSimulatorGUI

# Instantiate the CacheSimulator class and run simulations
cache_simulator = CacheSimulator(cache_size=1024, block_size=64, associativity=2)
cache_simulator.simulate_memory_accesses(memory_accesses=[(0x0A, "R"), (0x0B, "R")], text_widget=log_text)

# Create and run the GUI
root = tk.Tk()
gui = CacheSimulatorGUI(root)
root.mainloop()
```
